<h1> Each Book </h1>
<h2>The GamePlan</h2>
<p>This book is the introduction to the main character's life. In this book we see the parts of Sam that nobody else sees or will see. It includes the events that lead Sam to live the tragic life she lives.</p>
<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>This book begins with Sam in High School. Here, she forgets some of the painful details that revolve around her and her life. She loses her inhibitions and enjoys life, but faces the consequences that result from her actions.</p>
<h2>The EndGame</h2>
<p>In the last book, she remembers again that her whole life is played by other people. No matter how hard she tries to take control, she will never be the one in control. That is the true curse that the gift brings.</p>
