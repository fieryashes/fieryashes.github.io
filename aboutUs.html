<h2>Derek</h2>
<p>Derek was busy, so I'm gonna tell you about him. He is the oldest of us four. He is Air. Sky and Derek together are notorious for scheming and being overprotective of everyone. They however have differnt tactics to go about saving the rest of us. Derek likes to have us be ableto fight for ourselves, which gets him in trouble witih Sky all the time.</p>
<h2>Mia</h2>
<p>Mia is the most normal one of us. She loves to hunt, but not as much as me...
She loves to read. Mia has won several spelling bees becasue her vocabulary is far greater than anyone elses. Otherwise, she is a very quiet, secretive person who is great at keeping secrets for others. Mia is the go to person to talk to.</p>
<h2>Ethan</h2>
<p>Hi its Derek. I am not overprotective...Sam just thinks I am. Anyway, Sam refused to write about Ethan, so here I am. Okay. But. I. Am. Not. Overprotective.</p>
<p>Guys, its Mia here because derek can't betrusted to take this seriously. Okay so Ethan is Sam's twin brother.</p>
<h2>Sam</h2>
<p> Hi, I am your host. The others are either dead or lazy. So I hope you enjoy going through this website. Um. Derek and Mia wanted me to be nicer to you so um have fun...I guess. Bye.</p>
<h2>Keith</h2>
<p>He is the oldest and the most evil.</p>
