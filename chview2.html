<h1>Chapter 2 of The GamePlan</h1>
<h2>Derek's Viewpoint</h2>
<div id="chapter">
<p>When Derek came home he found a letter at his doorstep. It was from Sky. He hadnâ€™t seen him for three years now. He opened the letter as he walked in. It talked about Sky wanting to meet up and discuss the situation with Sam's gift. Derek was confused. He needed a new master plan. He had to figure out how to lie to Keith and keep Sam safe. If Sky could help out it would be great, but Sky had too many others to look after and he wouldn't be able to risk so many lives. The truth was that Derek was just frustrated with the way life was playing out. First his mother died and then he found out that his father was the one who murdered her. Derek felt done with his life. He was only so old and he was already taking care of three kids. He also didn't understand why his older brother Keith was suddenly so mean. Ever since their parents died Keith had separated himself from the others and all he cared about was getting the gift. It was almost as if he was happy that mom was dead. Well the point was that Sam was in trouble and he couldn't do anything about it. He reached into his pocket and dialed the number on the letter. </p>
