<h2>Derek</h2>
<p>Derek was busy, so I'm gonna tell you about him. He is the oldest of us four. He is Air. Sky and Derek together are notorious for scheming and being overprotective of everyone. They however have differnt tactics to go about saving the rest of us. Derek likes to have us be ableto fight for ourselves, which gets him in trouble witih Sky all the time.</p>

<p> This is where Derek formulates his plans. When mom and dad died, he ran off for a while. Apparently he found this place and stayed here for a few days. He also uses this place to meet with Sky. Don't tell him that I know about his place though...This is how I find out about his plans...</p>
