  <h1>The GAME</h1>
  </div>
  <p>My life is a game. Not the fun type of game where you control what you want to. No. Instead, I am the pon the player uses to have his own fun. Oh yeah, the player is Keith, my evil older brother. </p>
  <p>I have had the help of my siblings who are also thrown around in life as if they are pawns</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Derek (air)</li>
    <li>Mia (water)</li>
    <li>Ethan (Earth)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Siblings?</h2>
  <p>Even though i only have 3 siblings, I have plenty of cousins. We are all pretty close so I kinda just call them siblings. I have listed their names in order from oldest to youngest.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Derek</li>
    <li>Sky</li>
    <li>Zach</li>
    <li>Travis</li>
    <li>Jake</li>
    <li>Brandon</li>
    <li>Luke</li>
    <li>Ashley</li>
    <li>Nikki</li>
    <li>Mia</li>
    <li>Ethan</li>

    <p>You probably want more information about my life now, so I have given you the link to wikipedia below.<br> Enjoy.</p>

    <p>Before I go, even though you've probably figure this out by now, I am fire. However, I am not only fire, I also have a gift, a gift that could very well be more valuable than me.</p>

    <div id="mypic">
    <span title="”mypic" :)”="">This Is Me!</span>
    <img id="me" src="http://pre14.deviantart.net/8d2e/th/pre/i/2012/089/7/c/the_witch_by_thedurrrrian-d4ue4h5.jpg", height = 400, width = 280>
    <p> Ok so, I do not actually wear those clothes. That was just a cool effect that I wanted to create for the picture. My clothes are actually pretty normal.</p>

   <div id="rose">
   <span title="Curse.">My gift is more of a curse. It has never done any good. </span>
   <img id="rosee" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgxplqtxWq1qepugpo1_500.gif" alt="Rose" align="middle">
   <p>If I use it, I will have to face conequences and any use of the gift comes with several morality issues. Also, the gift has some prophecy that comes with it. The sad thing is that nobody has heard this prophecy except for the devil. Which does me and any kind soul in the world no good. Everybody wants my gift so that they can use it to their advantages. I would gladly give it up, but the gift cannot fall into the wrong hands. Thus, I have to guard it.</p>
