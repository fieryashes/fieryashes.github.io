<h2>Mia</h2>
<p>Mia is the most normal one of us. She loves to hunt, but not as much as me...
She loves to read. Mia has won several spelling bees becasue her vocabulary is far greater than anyone elses. Otherwise, she is a very quiet, secretive person who is great at keeping secrets for others. Mia is the go to person to talk to.</p>

<p> She loves to be near water.</p>

<p> This is where Mia spent most of her time when we were younger. She used to sneak into the realm of lost magic to come see me. Nobody knew that Mia did this. It was our secret. If Keith found out, she would have been dead too.</p>
